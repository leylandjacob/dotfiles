One thing you'll need to do manually is add your `~/.zshrc` file. You can't symlink the `.zshrc` file from your dotfiles because Mackup will already symlink your `.zshrc` from your home directory. That's why we'll need to create the file manually. Add the contents below to a `.zshrc` file in your user directory. What it will do is load the `.zshrc` file from your dotfiles. Make sure that the path to your dotfiles is correct.

```zsh
# Load Zsh
source ~/.dotfiles/.zshrc
```
